# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am proud of the challenges I am facing, hence learning from scratch makes me feel like a toddler who is mubmbling some words. In the same way I am learning code without previous knowledge and that makes me proud as I am already seeing how my learning is expanding.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
I am thinking the power of using methods in our applications lies in the ability to instruct the machine to do something with the information we give it, returning a value. So we can benefit by making code more efficiently
